The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common error where the `calc()` function is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results or rendering issues. Specifically, the space between the operator and the value within `calc()` is missing in some places:

```css
.element {
  width:calc(100%-10px); /* Missing space after the minus sign */
  height: calc(50% + 20px);/* Missing space before the plus sign*/
  margin: calc(10px/2); /* Missing space before and after the division sign*/
}
```

This can lead to the CSS parser misinterpreting the expression and causing unexpected behavior. For example, `calc(100%-10px)` might not calculate correctly due to the missing space.

Another example is the usage of units within `calc()`. Mixing units without explicit conversion can lead to unexpected behavior. For example,

```css
.element{
  width: calc(100px + 10em);
}
```

This will result in unexpected output since `px` and `em` are different units and the browser may not handle such arithmetic directly.
